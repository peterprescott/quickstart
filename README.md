# DataOps Quickstart

This is intended to act as a quickstart for Full-Stack DataOps, so that we immediately have:

- data analysis in Jupyter notebooks synchronized with .Rmd scripts;

- conversion to publication quality PDF with proper referencing, using Pandoc to convert .bib citations;

- backend API served by a Python Flask server that uses SQLAlchemy to interface with a SQLite database;

- frontend interface with dynamic data binding powered by Vue.js.

- appropriate Docker containers for all the necessary parts.
