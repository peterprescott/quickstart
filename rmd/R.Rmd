# Use RMarkdown...


...when you want to weave together code (it doesn't have to be R!), and narrative (efficiently written in Markdown).


## With R


But of course it could be R.

```{r}
print('hello world')
```

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,4)
print(x)
```

```{r}
y <- c(3,4,5,6)
print(y)
```

```{r}
plot(x,y)
```
